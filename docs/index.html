        In this assignment, we build a raytracing system that calculates ray itersections and recursive indirect
        lighting. It makes use of approximations of inifinte dimension integrals of light to calculate realistic 
        lighting of a scene. Discretizing continuous integrals is done through weighted averaging of discrete rays 
        with a ray PDF, BRDF, and application of Lambert's cosine law.
        </p>
       
    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>
        <p>
        We are assuming a geometric model of light. Thus, determining the lighting of a pixel can be done by casting
        rays from the camera to light rather than visa versa. This increases efficiency by guaranteeing utility of
        every raycast. Rays are cast from the camera point, through an image plane, and into the scene.  The pixel 
        the ray intersects in the image plane is the pixel lighting will be calculated for. To prevent aliasing, many 
        ray samples are uniformly randomly taken over the area of each pixel. These samples are 
        averaged to produce the final render output for that pixel. The basic premise of intersection in the scene
        is to calculate the earliest time (and concequently, distance since rays represented with unit vectors) at which the
        ray intersects the scene geometry (plane/sphere). This can be done through simple algebra.
        </p>
        <p>
        Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
        I implemented triangle intersection calculation by utilizing the Moller Trumbore Algorithm. The algorithm
        efficiently calculates both the intersection time and the barycentric coordinates of the intersection point
        with respect to the intersecting triangle. This is done by combining repeat calculations and vectorizing the
        process for easy parallelization. Conceptually, it finds the factor to which me must extend the direction vector
        of our ray to meet the triangle plane. It then finds relative areas of subtrinagles created by joining the intersection
        with each triangle vertex. These areas are proportional to the barycentric coordinates. 
        Once these values are calculated, one can check the sign of the
        barycentric coordinates. The ray intersects the triangle if time is within range (min and max for that ray) and
        all three barycentric coordiinates are positiive.
        </p>
        <p>
        Sphere intersection was done by solving the simplified quadratic equation for a ray through a sphere surface. If the
        quadratic has no real roots, there is no intersection. If there is one, it is a tangent intersection. If there 
        are two, find the one with the lowest t. That is the intersection. Number of roots can be quickly determined by
        observing the discriminant of the quadratic. Negative is no roots, 0 is tangent, positive is two roots.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Bounding Volume Heirarchy</h2>
        <p>
        My BVH construction is a recursive algorithm that splits the centroid box down the middle of the largest axis.
        Edge cases (perfectly on midpoint) are put into the "left" branch (lower position values). Recursion stops when
        a BVH node has less than or equal to the maximum leaf capacity. I chose a centroid box heuristic over a bounding
        box one because it guarantees at least one element in each child branch while a bounding box cannot. It is still,
        however, similarly simple to implement.
        </p>
        <p>
        My BVH intersection is also done recursively. Check for intersection. If there is, recurse on left and right
        children. If the node is a leaf, iterate over the primitives and check for intersections with each. We do not need
        to worry about finding the closest intersection as dynamically setting <code>max_t</code> variable ensures only the
        most recent intersection is saved. Bounding box intersection check is done by using the slab method. For
        each slab, I find the max and min of intersection. The max of the mins is the ray enter time of the bounding 
        box. The min of the maxes is the exit time. One thing to note is that the ray enter time can be negative and still
        have valid ray intersections with the geometry in the bounding box.

        BVH reduces the compute overhead by hundreds of times with a space tradeoff. BVH increases time to test for a ray intersection with a 
        specific primitive with the advantage of being able to very quickly test for no intersection (using BST). Since each ray intersects very few
        primitives and misses many, this provides a significant speedup. There is, however, an observable added delay to rendering with BVH as
        the BVH tree must first be constructed before raycasting in the scene. This means, that BVH has the potential to be slower when it comes 
        to very low poly scenes. Overall, however, BVH brings great improvement to efficiency. As it brings finding intersections in a scene from
        <code>O(p)</code> to <code>O(log p)</code> where <code>p</code> is the number of primitives.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
        <p>
       Uniform hemisphere sampling was done by uniformly generating outgoing rays from the point being lit. The intersection of the ray is tested 
       for emmission. The final light on that point is 
       <pre><code>&Sigma; emission * pdf * bsdf * lambert/ n</code></pre> 
       Where 'emission' is the
       light sample from
       the outgoing ray, 'pdf' is the sampling pdf (this case uniform 1/pi), 'bsdf' is material color, 'lambert' is the cosine law output,'n' is number
       of rays traced. We do not need to test for the pdf of the light source as that is already reflected in the probability of the outgoing ray 
       to hit the light source. In my implementation, I put the lambert cosine factor inside the bsdf to reduce clutter.
       </p>
       <p>
       Importance sampling was done by sampling in the direction of light sources. I sum over the area of the light sources and add their light
       contributions while considering the pdf of the light source. This pdf describes the chance I define for that specific ray of light to 
       shine in that direction. I take into account obstructions from the test point to the light source by aycasting between them and checking 
       for any premature intersections. The final light on the point is
       <pre><code>&Sigma; emission * pdf * bsdf * lambert/ (n * lpdf)</code></pre>
       The variables carry over from the previous part with an added 'lpdf'. lpdf is exactly the probability described earlier. I divide it
       becuase sampling more from a location requires that I reduce the weight. Otherwise, the integral of the light will be greater than the
       total emission.

        Number of light rays greatly affects the harshness of soft shadows. Lower light ray count cannot properly reflect gradients in shading and 
        shadows. Only up to 64 light rays for a sample does that sample semi-accurately represent the shadowing of that point. This concept is especially
        prevalent in the one ray image. A point is either shadowed or not. Thus, there are no intermediates in the shadows.
        </p>
        <p>
        Uniform hemisphere sampling is basic and intuitive. That, however, is all that it is good for. It is horribly inefficient for direct 
        lighting as the probability that a light probe ray actually hits a light source is slim. Thus, it takes many samples and light rays to construct even
        a moderately sufficient image. Light importance sampling fixes the flaws of uniform sampling. It is more sample efficient as the
        light samples contribute more the the image since they are trained toward light sources. The only downside is that it requires a predefined
        pdf to sample in. This pdf has to either be procedurally generated or inputted by the user.
        </p>
    <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
        <p>
       Indirect lighting was done through a recursive function. The function first calculates the direct lighting at the point.
       Then, it traces light rays to other points on the scene and adds decayed <code>L_out</code> from recursive calls on
       the light ray intersection points. The total light is
       <pre>
         <code>
           &Sigma; directlight +  recursivelight * pdf * bsdf * lambert/ (lpdf * p)
         </code>
       </pre>
       Variables are similar to previous formulas. 'p' is the continuation probability of the ray. There was casework for 
       death of the ray. The light ray has a 0.7 continuoation rate or 0.3 termination rate. I also 
       made sure that at least one bounce is calculated when the max bounce threshold is above 1. Termination always means
       adding pure black as 'recursivelight'.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
        <p>
          Adaptive sampling was simple to implement. I first made sure to simplify the threshold check equation to minimize
          square root and division operations. I then used modular arithmetic to split samples int blocks with a tail case
          for any leftovers. I also had to manage scaling the samples as the number of samples was now variable. I avoided
          losing too much precision by dividing by block size. When total count is determined (threshold is reached) I 
          divide again by the number of blocks that I got through. Tail case and updating counts was handled accordingly.
